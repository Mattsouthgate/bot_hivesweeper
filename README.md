# bot_hivesweeper
A Python Juypter notebook for automated play of the Hivesweeper game.
The game is online at: https://iogames.space/hivesweeper-io A multiplayer hexagon based minesweeper variant.
To use the code launch a Jupter notebook and load the code.
In the web browser of the game choose your name then select options and choose orange as your colour.  The HSV filters have been set for this colour.  The bot will not recognise your 'team colour' if it is not orange - normally colour is assigned randomly by the game.
Lastly run the code and start the game manually.  The bot will identify trapped and safe cells and claim them based on local logic.

Why I wrote this?
I have been learning Python for a while now, initially with CodeCombat, but mostly writing utilities and as an alternative to Matlab - entirely due to the license cost.
I stumbled across this game after playing starblast.io, a very good, fun and often challenging/frustrating multiplayer space resource collect and battle game, looking for something a little less frantic.  After playing for a bit I thought it would be interesting to write a bot to play the game, because it is relatively simple and the graphics are undynamic - except for you bee that follows the cursor.
